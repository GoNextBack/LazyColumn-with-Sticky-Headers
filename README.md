Explanation about the app

This app is a demo of using LazyColumn with sticky headers in Jetpack Compose.
It shows how to group a list of contacts by the first letter and display them with headers that stay at the top when scrolling.

Contact list: shows 50 generated contact names.

Sticky headers: each letter (A, B, C, …) stays visible while scrolling through its group.

Floating Action Button (FAB): appears after scrolling past item 10.

When tapped, it scrolls the list back to the top.

How to use the app

Open the app on an emulator or device.

Scroll down the contact list.

Notice that each letter header stays pinned at the top until the next one appears.

After you scroll past item 10, a FAB with “UP” will appear in the bottom-right corner.

Tap the FAB to smoothly scroll back to the top.
